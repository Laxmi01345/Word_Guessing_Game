# **Word Guessing Game**
A word guessing game is a fun and interactive activity where one person tries to convey a word or phrase to another person or a group, and the participants attempt to guess the correct answer based on the given clues.

# **Game Concept:**
The objective of the game is for the user to guess a word.
They have 5 chance to guess the correct word.
The word to be guessed is selected randomly from a predefined list of words.

# **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
The game initializes with a 5x5 matrix, where the user is expected to enter 5 alphabets.
The correct and incorrect guesses are visually indicated with green and red colors, respectively.
Each user is given 5 chances to guess the word.

# **Attempts Limit:**
Each user has a limited number of attempts, in this case, 5 chances to guess the word.
The remaining attempts are tracked, and if the user exhausts all attempts, the word is revealed in red, indicating that the user did not successfully guess it.

# **Reset Functionality:**
The game provides a reset functionality.
When the user clicks the "Enter" button and either correctly guesses the word or exhausts all attempts, the game resets.
A new word is selected for the user to guess, and the attempts counter is reset to 5.
